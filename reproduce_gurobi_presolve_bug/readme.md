Gurobi (ver11.0.3) may recover wrong superpolys if "presolve()" is used

Here is an example showing Gurobi generates different superpolys when different presolve levels are set. By seting the "presolve level" to the default value "-1" (or equivalently not use the following codes explictly):

model.set(GRB_IntParam_Presolve, -1);

The superpoly generated by Gubori for this example has 6 monomials, while setting the presolve level to 0(off), (1)conservative, or (2) aggressive, the nubmers of monomials are all 52488.

We also found some exmaples in which Gurobi produced different superpolys when setting the presolve level to 0 and 2.
