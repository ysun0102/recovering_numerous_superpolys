## Files:

### ./Data_spolys
The polynomials were obtained in the Offline Phase of the practical attack.

### ./Sat_solve

+ ***solve.py***: Python implementation of Algorithm 4("Solving the system constructed by the superpolys by testing").
    + ***line285***: Generate a secret key by random
    + ***line289***: Use a preset key (Hexadecimal)
+ ***polynomials***:  A folder storing a series of polynomial sets.
+ ***Output Information (on-screen)***:
    + ***"round 2"***: The index of the iteration.
    + ***"untested vars"***: The list of indices of the untested secret variables, sorted by the increasing order of the appearing times.
    + ***"to test var"***: The index of the variable to be tested.
    + ***"current_assigns"***: The list of the assignments determined in previous iterations. Specifically, ['k58=1', 'k61=0'] means k58=1 and k61=0, which obtains from previous tests.
    + ***"both_has_solutions"***: The list of indices of variables whose values cannot be determined.
    + ***"testing k61 == 0"***: Testing whether k61 == 0 leads to a contradiction.
    + ***"cnf:  ['k58=1', 'k59=1', 'k61=0'] "***: Assigning {k58 = 1, k59 = 1, k61 = 0}.
    + ***"Find solution~~~"***: Found a soltuion by assigning {k58 = 1, k59 = 1, k61 = 0}.
    + ***"testing k61 == 1"***: Testing whether k61 == 1 leads to a contradiction.
    + ***"cnf:  ['k58=1', 'k59=1', 'k61=1']  "***: Assigning {k58 = 1, k59 = 1, k61 = 1}.
    + ***"No solution!"***: Found a contradiciton by assigning {k58 = 1, k59 = 1, k61 = 1}, which implies k61 == 0 must hold.
